# go-watch-a-movie
 This project is about creating a single page application in React, with data supplied by a Go back end REST API.
 
 I am completely new to both Go and React. Knowing that they both work well together, I wanted to learn how to create a simple application and learn by doing (how I learn best).
 
 This project is by Trevor Sawler on Udemy.
